# clients.conf — Static NAS client definitions
#
# Most NAS clients (MikroTik routers) are loaded dynamically from the
# "nas" database table via the SQL module (read_clients = yes in sql config).
# FreeRADIUS reads the nas table at startup, so restart the container
# after adding a new router:  docker restart wassal-freeradius
#
# The entries below are only for infrastructure and debugging.

client localhost {
    ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
    secret = 7bc4868eb55a46be6c9fc4f0706ed8b7
    shortname = localhost
}

# Docker internal network — allows radtest from host or other containers
client dockernet {
    ipaddr = 172.16.0.0/12
    secret = 7bc4868eb55a46be6c9fc4f0706ed8b7
    shortname = docker
}

# SECURITY NOTE: The previous 0.0.0.0/0 catch-all has been removed.
# In production, each MikroTik router should be registered through
# the admin dashboard, which inserts it into the nas table with a
# unique per-router RADIUS secret. Restart FreeRADIUS after adding
# a new router so it picks up the updated nas table.
